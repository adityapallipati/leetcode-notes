STACKS
- Last In, First Out
- push, adds to end O(1)
- pop, removes form end O(1)
- peek/top, retrieves first elem O(1)

example:

stacks are conceptually like this

[0] <- last
[1] <- third
[2] <- second
[3] <- first

this is equivalent to stack = [3,2,1,0]

remove elem from stack:

[1] <- last
[2] <- second
[3] <- first

this is equivalent to stack = [3,2,1,0]

stack.pop()

stack = [3,2,1]

push = adding to top
pop = removing top elem
peek = looking at top elem

Leetcode # 682 Baseball Game

You are keeping the scores for a baseball game with strange rules. At the beginning of the game, you start with an empty record.

You are given a list of strings operations, where operations[i] is the ith operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

An integer x.
Record a new score of x.
'+'.
Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
'D'.
Record a new score that is the double of the previous score.
'C'.
Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return the sum of all the scores on the record after applying all the operations.

let's walk through the stack with the operations being operations = ["5","2","C","D","+"]

first one is "5"

so our stack looks like this conceptually:

[5]

and is implemented like this: stack = [5]

next is "2"

so now our stack is like this:

og  curr
    [2]
[5] [5]

stack = [5,2]

next is "C"

so we remove 2 with stack.pop() which removes the last elem form an array

og      curr
    [X]
[5] [5] [5]

stack = [5]

next is "D" so we double 5 and add that res to our stack

5 * 2 is 10

og          curr
    [X]     [10]
[5] [5] [5] [5]

stack = [5,10]

next is "+" so we add the last val in the stack plus the second to last

5 + 10 is 15

og                curr
                  [15]
    [X]     [10]  [10]
[5] [5] [5] [5]   [5]


at this point we reached the end of the loop so we have the sum statement to execute

we get the sum of [5,10,15]

5 + 10 + 15 is 30

our final result is the integer 30
